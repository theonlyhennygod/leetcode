Hint
Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n.


Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 150

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}

var smallestEvenMultiple = function(n) {

    // the smallest multiple of 2 

    // if the n is odd, then we multiply the n by 2

    // if it's even, we multiply n by 1 

    // check if n is greater than or equal to 0 : edge case

    // return n = Int
